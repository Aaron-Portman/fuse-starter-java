# fuse-starter-java
This project serves two functions:
- Provides reference implementations for various features using our best-practices
- Provides a starting point for new galatea java projects

This readme will contain an index to features and their location in code.

##  Components
FUSE suggests that you break up your application into the following components.  Many of these correspond to spring stereotypes:
- **Entry points**: Components that receive stimuli from the outside world and react to them.  This can include REST requests, JMS messages, files.  You'll find examples of these in the org.galatea.starter.entrypoint package.
- **Services**: We embrace the micro-service architecture and suggest putting business logic inside small services that can be composed together to perform a business function.  Services may perform business processing themselves or make out-of-process calls to other services (e.g. another team's web service).   You should strive to inject a single service into each entry point class.   This service can then be composed of multiple other services.  Examples of these can be found in org.galatea.starter.service
- **Domain objects**: These are your "model" entities that represent your business objects and data model.  These should be anemic objects  i.e. primarily data containers with little business logic.  Examples of these can be found in org.galatea.starter.domain
- **Repositories**:  These components handle interactions with your "persistence" layer.  This could include a database, a distributed cache, a file, etc. Repositories should be injected into Services that need to store data.  Examples can be found in org.galatea.starter.domain.rpsy.
